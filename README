Project Info:

  * Steeze front-end starter kit 
  * by Wil Everts (@cousinwil)
  * http://st.eeze.us
  * Version 0.3 - 9/4/2011

  Yo, my name is Wil. I make stuff on the web for fun and profit. I'm a front
  end web geek who works at Yammer as a Senior UI Engineer on the Web Team. This
  is my personal boilerplate that I use to start my web projects. As I go along
  I update this based on my usage of it in the wild. I've recently used this in
  a few projects including:

  - Yammer's API Developer Site, http://developer.yammer.com
  - NodeConf Summer Camp's Site, http://www.nodeconf.com/summercamp.html
  - The reimplementation of the old Powder Envy visualization (a precursor to the
    new PE app, which is in-development now), http://powderenvy.com
  - My Team's Node.ko project, http://bearshark.nko2.nodeknockout.com

  I will be adding line by line documentation shortly. Wonder why something is
